# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I'm most proud of being able to figure out and write out all the answers in 'buildInMethods.js' *BEFORE* running the program and seeing what appears in the console. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    - Functions are a powerful tool in our applications because they allow the user to write chunks of code that can be used over and over again.
